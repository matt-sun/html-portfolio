<h1>The Best Movies According to Me</h1>

<h2>My top 3 Movies of this year.</h2>

<hr>

<h3>Le Comte de Monte-Cristo</h3>
<p>A French Classic very well depicted and rendered, keeping the core interpretation and combining great screenplay.</p>

<h3>Deadpool & Wolverine</h3>
<p>Mostly for fans but great fan service, as funny as the previous ones, glorious scenes.</p>

<h3>Jury nÂ°2</h3>
<p>Predictable scenario but perfectly executed, ending as a cliffhanger to let your imagination go wild.</p>
